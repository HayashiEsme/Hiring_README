# Hiring README

Hi there, you might have found my github via my resume - but noticed nothing is up. That's cause they're private repos. You will have to (and should) [contact me](xuan.lim@u.nus.edu) to ask me for access to view my codebases. 

### On my background: 
I'm an embedded systems nerd who studies Data Science and Computer Science undergraduate in NUS. I love working on stuff that makes people's lives easier. In my years of undergraduate explorations that often meant interdisciplinary things - which is why you'll notice the wide array of fields in my side projects. But these days I consider myself an (Embedded Systems) Software Engineer who's not afraid to use all her toolchains within her arsenal to solve a problem ( - without overcomplicating, and if it benefits, of course.)

Recently I've worked at Intel's iCDG as an Embedded Systems Software Engineering Intern where I rewrote a graphing tool used to help production - improving performance quite significantly and giving it an UI makeover. 

If you've perhaps not seen my CV and would like to have a look, you can also [contact me](xuan.lim@u.nus.edu) and I'll send you a copy

Things I've Made (in my own time):
- "World of Warcraft Realm Inspect" - an app that helps users pick a new realm that they will find a good community to play with, whatever their playstyle of choice (Progress: Frontend (iOS app) 75% complete, Backend (Flask, hosted on my Raspi): WIP)
- A 3D-Printed, Ardiuno-controlled Robot Arm, printed, assembled and programmed - Something I'm in the process of making, pending a new 3D Printer of mine to come 
- (I've attempted) a replication of a Machine Learning paper
